/* This is list of all QtMips specific exceptions
 *
 * Input:
 *  Exception durring input loading
 * Runtime:
 *  Exceptions caused by machine invalid input or unsupported action
 * UnsupportedInstruction:
 *  Decoded instruction is not supported.
 *  This can be cause by really using some unimplemented instruction or because of problems in instruction decode.
 * UnsupportedAluOperation:
 *  Decoded ALU operation is not supported
 *  This is basically same exception as QtMipsExceptionUnsupportedInstruction but it is emmited from ALU when executed and not before that.
 * Overflow:
 *  Integer operation resulted to overflow (or underflow as we are working with unsigned values)
 *  This is for sure caused by program it self.
 * UnalignedJump:
 *  Instruction is jumping to unaligned address (ADDR % 4 != 0)
 *  This can be caused by bug or by user program as it can be jumping relative to register
 *  This shouldn't be happening with non-register jumps as those should be verified by compiler
 * UnknownMemoryControl:
 *  Used unknown MemoryAccess control value (write_ctl or read_ctl)
 *  This can be raised by invalid instruction but in such case we shoul raise UnknownInstruction instead
 *  So this should signal just some QtMips bug.
 * OutOfMemoryAccess:
 *  Trying to access address outside of the memory
 *  As we are simulating whole 32bit memory address space then this is most probably QtMips bug if raised not program.
 * Sanity:
 *  This is sanity check exception
